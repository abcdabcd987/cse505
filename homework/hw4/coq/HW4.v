(*
 * CSE 505 18au Homework 4 - Semantics and Interpreters
 *
 * In this homework, you will finish writing an interpreter for a small
 * imperative programming language Imp. Some of the interpreter is given to
 * you.  You will write your interpreter in such a way that it behaves
 * according to the semantics that are already given to you. You will then
 * prove that this is true.
 *
 * This homework is spread across two files, ImpInterp and ImpInterpProof:
 *)

Require Import Imp.ImpInterp.
Require Import Imp.ImpInterpProof.

(*
 * You should do the problems in each of these files.
 *
 * It will be helpful to familiarize yourself with the syntax (ImpSyntax.v)
 * and semantics (ImpEval.v) of Imp before beginning. It may also help to
 * browse some of the lemmas in ImpCommon.v and ImpSemanticsFacts.v.
